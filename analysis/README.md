# Analysis Folder

- This folder contains all individual notebooks, as well as any notebooks that we do not wish to be viewed and graded. Other notebooks may be added by the discretion of each team member. However, to keep this project from blowing out of proportion, try to keep any additional notebooks to a minimum.
