    "Upon being introduced to the applications of statistics, \n",
    "I developed a passion for data science as it allows me to express the creative side that I never knew I had. I am constantly being introduced to various methods and models that allow me to explore data and extract information that is hidden behind a table of numbers and letters. Creating the graphs, tables, charts, and reports from the data is where all that creativity goes. The creativity and freedom here grants me the ability to find hidden stories in the data that are not apparent without the steps involved with data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, my interest is in learning about the popularities of some of the sports over the history that the sport has been played in the Olympics. So far, I'm mostly interested in winter olympic sports like snowboarding and skating because I recently learned how to snowboard, and figure skating simply because I think its a pretty sport to watch. I am hoping to find the information necessary to answer my questions by looking at how many participants are in the Olympics in each of these sports in each year.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am also keen on finding out how many athletes actually win a medal in their first appearance at an Olympic games. This should be fairly easy to find if there exists a column that lists each athletes first year of participation. With this info, all I will need to do is check if they won a medal in that year."

    "**Exploration Plan:** To find out this information, I will need to get an idea of what columns each dataframe has. Then my plan is to first merge all of the together and drop all of the columns that I think are irrelevent information for this question. I should also find how many unique sports there are to get an idea of what kind of visualization I could use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since my research question is looking at \"similar\" sports, I should write a function that will allow me to specify which sports I want to look at. Having this function will help with the repeatability of my analysis in case I want to analyze and compare many similar sports.\n",
