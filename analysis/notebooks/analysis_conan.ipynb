    "## Research Interests:\n",
    "\n",
    "My background is in integrative physiology research where I have been exposed to both the process of data collection and intial exploratory data analysis where descriptive stats, summary tables, and intial data visuilizations are produced. That intial EDA often involves heavy cleaning of our raw data before being imported in R studio for further analysis. My reserch intrests in my academic life revolve around identify sex differences in physiological responses in male and females, so no better comparrison than identifiying how the ratio of male to female medal holders compare across countries. My personal background is high performance sport, a passio I bring into the lab and my everyday life. As such there is no better data set than olympic results. My research questions are listed and summarized below: \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Q1: How does the ratio of male to female medal holders vary across years. \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question I aim to compare the ammount of male vs female medla holders in the top contrey each year and identify if certain countries house predomenatly female or male medal winners. I first plan to use the medal results data, group by country and identify the number male and female medal holders for each country. From there I hope to identify which country containes the most male and most female medal holders. I would like to present this as a diffrence of male and female medal holders so I will need to add a column for each country with the number of medals won by men and women. I would also like to see how this changes over time. I would like to present this as a bar graph showing the proportion of male medal winners and female medal winners for each years top winning country. Next I would like to create a line plot showing how the diffrence of male vs female medal discrepency changes over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: How does the country with the most medal holders at each game change over time and is this title associated with being the host country. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question I plan to summarise the total number of medals attained at each game by country and identify the overall winner. From there I hope to compile a new sumarised data set where each country that attended the games have a total number of medals won where I then hope to plot all attendeing countries over time to see how the medal holding leaders change over time. I would also like to see if this has to do with being the host country that year. To do so I plan to compare avg medals won by non host countries attending the games and avg medals won by host countries. Out of intrest I would also like to see if this changes over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both my research questions some data wrangling will be needed. I most likely will combine the medal and host data sets to answer my second question and utilize the medals data set for my first. \n",

    "\n",
    "Above I show the number of medals won by the top country each year split into male and total medal winners. I've excluded open and mixed sports for simplicity and to compare the absolute nubmer of male medal winners to female medal winners. It appears just by looking at the plot males appear to win more medals however after 1994 this appears to even out a bit although that claim can not be validated just by looking at it. Fortunatly There is a table that tells you what years females did better than males at the games. We can see that in 1998, 2008, 2012, and 2020 females made up a greater portion of the total medals won compared to males. In the grand scheme of things males appear to make up a greater portion of medals won by the top country at each years games however this trend is reducing with the more recent games. "

    "This inital EDA took about about 5ish hours of workin. I am fortunate to have lots of experaince wrangling and cleaning data in R and I found it helpful to draft out my analysis and EDA plan in R before converting it to python (a language I am new to). My primary research questions are sill valid and I think I can produce some very meaningful plots to show off my answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "My first question asks \"How does the ratio of male to female medal holders vary across countries?\". Currently I have shown the top 10 highest medal counts ever and my next step would be to create a facet wraped plot where each year I show the top 10 medal count winners from that games and show what % of it came from males or females. To get some qunatitative data I would like to manipulate (max, mins, means, IQRs) the data frame to see what the highest female % is  as well as see the average % contribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "My next question asks \"How does the country with the most medal holders at each game change over time and is this title associated with being the host country?\". Currently I have merged the historic host data frame and the historic medal data frame togehter to show where each games was hosted. Fortunatly I also have the countries of the medal winners and I would like to see how the numbers of medals won by host countries differ to the number of medals won by the non host country (compare mean nonhost to host) I would also like to plot the medal winners using facet grid with the columns set as host country. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I came up with a new question out of curiosity...which I belive is the name of the game. I would like to see which sport is most female and male dominated and does this differ by country? Currently I have selected the 2022 games dataset as I feel it is unreasonable to create an analysis for every single games nor would it be feasible to find athlete manifests for each of the games. My next possible analysis step would be to compare how many male vs female atheltes were sent to each sport, male vs female medal winners for each country, and how the % of total medal counts vary across countries. Based on my inital EDA it seemed that most countreis send more males than females to the 2022 games, my next step I would like to take is to compare the top 10 medal winners at the 2022 games and see what % of thoose medals were won by males and females. I think a good plot to use could be a stacked bar blot to show this off. "
