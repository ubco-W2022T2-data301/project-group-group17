    "## Research Interests:\n",
    "\n",
    "My background is in integrative physiology research where I have been exposed to both the process of data collection and intial exploratory data analysis where descriptive stats, summary tables, and intial data visuilizations are produced. That intial EDA often involves heavy cleaning of our raw data before being imported in R studio for further analysis. My reserch intrests in my academic life revolve around identify sex differences in physiological responses in male and females, so no better comparrison than identifiying how the ratio of male to female medal holders compare across countries. My personal background is high performance sport, a passio I bring into the lab and my everyday life. As such there is no better data set than olympic results. My research questions are listed and summarized below: \n",
    "\n",
    "##  Q1: How does the ratio of male to female medal holders vary across countries. \n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question I aim to compare the ammount of male vs female medla holders in various contries and identify if certain countries house predomenatly female or male medal winners. I first plan to use the medal results data, group by country and identify the number male and female medal holders for each country. From there I hope to identify which country containes the most male and most female medal holders. I would like to present this as a % of men and % of female medal holders so I will need to add a column for each country with the % of male and % of female medal holders. I would also like to see how this % changes over time in each country. I would like to present this as a horizontal bar graph showing cummilitive data and then a seperate line graph comparing the top 25 medal winning countires (over the entire time span of the data set) to compare how their ratio of male:female medal holders change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Q2: How does the country with the most medal holders at each game change over time and is this title associated with being the host country. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question I plan to summarise the total number of medals attained at each game by country and identify the overall winner. From there I hope to compile a new sumarised data set where each country that attended the games have a total number of medals won where I then hope to plot all attendeing countries over time to see how the medal holding leaders change over time. I would also like to see if this has to do with being the host country that year. To do so I plan to compare avg medals won by non host countries attending the games and avg medals won by host countries. Out of intrest I would also like to see if this changes over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both my research questions some data wrangling will be needed. I most likely will combine the medal and host data sets to answer my second question and utilize the medals data set for my first. \n",
