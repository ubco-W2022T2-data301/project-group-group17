## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Olympics and Paralympics datasets that we found on kaggle.com includes a vast amount of information dating back over 100 years with thousands of data points for us to play with. Although, it does have information we may not need; ie: athletes place-of-birth, we know that because of the size of the dataset we are confident that we will be able to zero in on a specific topic using the information in this dataset to produce a strong project.
