## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

History is prominent topic in elementary to highschool education that focuses on critical and cruciual moments of the past that have shaped the pathways in today's society. Since the Olympics have been around since 776 B.C., they are a prominent topic in athletics. The Olympics were originally created to honour the ancient Greek Gods, but more specifically Zeus, who was known to be a ruler and protector. The Olympic games were also famously known to present the ancient Greek's passion for competition. Our topic of interest has been founded around analyzing the history and parameters of the Summer and Winter Olympics from 1986 to 2020. Our overall interests are focused on analyzing ideas such as correlations between competition. There is potential interest to also analyze the history behind Summer and Winter Paralympics from 1986 to 2020, depending on our vision statement for the project.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The Olympics and Paralympics datasets that we found on kaggle.com includes a vast amount of information dating back over 100 years with thousands of data points for us to play with. Although, it does have information we may not need; ie: athletes place-of-birth, we know that because of the size of the dataset we are confident that we will be able to zero in on a specific topic using the information in this dataset to produce a strong project.
