# Project Vision

By analyzing a couple datasets related to the Olympics, our team hopes to gain insight on some of the trends that have arisen over an amount of time that we have yet to decide one. Since it is only milestone 1 , our team has not had the chance to fully investigate each dataset and come up with an end goal for the project. However, after viewing the categories and some of the content, some potential analyses include:

1. "The advantage of being the host during the Olympics"
2. "An analysis of the sports and countries that earn the most medals"
3. "The comparison of the amount of medals earned during the summer olympics and winter olympics for each country"

As more information on the desired outcome of each milestone arises, our vision statement will develop.

## Contracted Grade

For this project, we originally agreed to contract for a B. As of the end of milestone 4, we agree to contract for an A.
